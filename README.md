This is a project done for my institution to automate the events aproval form here the flow goes from like 

1.login page from login.php

2.Based on the username and password you entered the backend will automatically logged in if you entered credentials for user it goes into as a user or if it is a hod then it will go hod_login.php or principal it goes to principal_login.php

3.once entered you will go to home1.php then clicking new event goes to form1.php

4.After submission an email which is autogenerated notifies the next approver that is hod

5.After the approval of hod again an email will be sent to notify the principal

6.once principal approved or rejected the user will get notification in between
